# 04_Extra: Polars API Topics Not Covered in Main Tutorials

This folder contains additional scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating Polars API features not addressed in the main 01_basics, 02_intermediate, or 03_advanced tutorials. Each topic is covered with a runnable Python script and a companion notebook, including explanations and example data where needed.

Topics include:

- DataFrame/Series attributes and meta-info (e.g., schema, dtypes, shape, columns, flags)
- DataFrame methods such as `pipe`, `partition_by`, `merge_sorted`, `interpolate`, etc.
- Advanced selection and iteration (`item`, `iter_columns`, `iter_rows`, `iter_slices`)
- Arrow, NumPy, and Torch export methods
- Miscellaneous: `hash_rows`, `fold`, `estimated_size`, `glimpse`, etc.
